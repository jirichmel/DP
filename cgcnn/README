The implementation of the crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) of xie18 paper.

The PyTorch implementation (from the original paper) is available at https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn

The Julia implementation is available at https://github.com/aced-differentiate/AtomicGraphNets.jl/blob/master/src/

It is necessary to have python and some python packages as dependencies to get the pipeline of the Julia CGCNN running: https://github.com/aced-differentiate/AtomicGraphNets.jl

The CGCNN crystal graph construction can be found in https://github.com/aced-differentiate/ChemistryFeaturization.jl/tree/master/src/pmg_graphs.jl
